# ‚úÖ FIXED - How to Start the App

## The Problem Before
You weren't running the app with the virtual environment, so dependencies weren't found!

## The Correct Way to Start

### Option 1: Using the virtual environment (RECOMMENDED)
```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/rishi/claudeprojects/web-proxy-vpn

# Activate virtual environment and run
./venv/bin/python3 app_google.py
```

### Option 2: Quick start script
```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/rishi/claudeprojects/web-proxy-vpn
chmod +x start_app.sh
./start_app.sh
```

Then open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

## How to Access Google Docs (CORRECTLY)

### ‚ùå WRONG WAY (Won't Work):

1. On the dashboard, click **"Login with Google"**
2. You'll see the REAL Google login page (in your browser!)
3. Enter your Google email and password
4. Click **"Allow"** to grant permissions
5. You'll be redirected to the **Drive Browser**
6. Now you can:
   - Browse your files
   - Upload files (drag & drop)
   - Download files (choose format: PDF, DOCX, etc.)
   - Search for files

## For Non-Google Websites

The regular proxy works fine for other sites:
- Enter URL (like `youtube.com` or `reddit.com`)
- Click "Go"
- Site loads through proxy
